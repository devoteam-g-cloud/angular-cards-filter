# Front

A filter pipe compatible with angular paginator that can filter any data array that is not of type MatDataSource.
Very handy when we have a dataSource not compatible with MatDataSource out of the box provided filter.


## Install  
Run `npm i`
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
